			  <h1>Graph settings</h1>
			  <p class="sectionIntro">In this window you can control  the style and the layout of the plot.</p>
			  <div class="versionHint">
			    <strong>This manual refers to LiveGraph version 1.1.X.</strong><br />
				While version 2.0.X is similar in general, there are several key improvements.<br />
				We are working on the manual for version 2.0.X. and will make it available as soon as possible. 
			  </div> <!-- div class="versionHint" -->
			  <h2>Highlight data points</h2>
			  <p><strong>This is a hidden setting.</strong> When  you move the mouse over the <a href="dataPlot.html">plot window</a>, LiveGraph paints small circles around  the data points in the vicinity of the mouse cursor. This is called data point  highlighting. At the same time as points are highlighted in the <a href="dataPlot.html">plot window</a>, the  rows corresponding to the data series on which the points are highlighted are  also highlighted in the<a href="dataSeriesSettings.html"> data series settings window</a>. In addition, when you press the left mouse button while the mouse cursor is over the plotter area, a small pop-up window will be displayed with a list of all data series on which points are highlighted at that moment. This feature helps you  read the graph when there are many series plotted together.</p>
		      <p>This feature uses functionality available in Java version 1.6 and later. If you are using Java 1.5 this feature may not be available or it may cause error messages being displayed in the <a href="mainWindow.html">main window</a>.<br />
	        In addition, this feature is unfortunately relatively computationally expensive. Despite various optimisations employed, locating the  points in the vicinity of the mouse cursor is a computationally expensive task.  For modern desktop PCs this does not present any real challenge you will hardly notice the calculations.  However, if you are  using an older computer, the extra load on the processor may be annoying and  you might want to switch data points highlighting off.</p>
		    <p>Because the reasons for turning data point highlighting off are of such permanent nature and do not quickly go, we did not include an option for turning this feature on and off in the user interface (after all, a concise interface is one of LiveGraph's hallmarks). However, you can still change this setting by editing the graph settings file:<br />
	        First, save your current graph settings  using the menu in the <a href="mainWindow.html">main application window</a>. Then, open the <kbd>.lggs</kbd> file where  you just saved the settings with your favourite text editor. Find the entry  with the key &quot;<code>HighlightDataPoints</code>&quot; and change its value from <kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>0</kbd>; save the  file. Now you can load you LiveGraph graph settings from the modified file and  the data point highlighting will be disabled. If you want to switch the feature  back on, reverse the procedure.</p>
		    <h2>Viewport</h2>
			  <p>Here you can select the  visible data area for the plot. For instance, if you select <strong>minX</strong> = <samp>0</samp> and <strong>maxX</strong> =  <samp>20</samp>, LiveGraph will plot all data points for which the X-coordinate value is  between 0 and 20. Similarly, setting <strong>minY</strong> = <var>y'</var> and <strong>maxY</strong> = <var>y''</var> results in only the points with the Y-coordinate value <var>y</var> being plotted such that <var>y'</var>	&le; <var>y</var> &le; <var>y''</var>. If you select <strong>auto</strong>, LiveGraph will automatically find the  smallest (or largest) values available. So, if you set all four boundaries to <samp>auto</samp>, you will be able to see the complete graph.</p>
			  <p>Note, in order to apply the  changes after you have edited a value in one of the fields, you need to press the Enter-key or to move  the cursor out of the field by clicking on any other field or button in the  graph settings window.</p>
			  <h2>Vertical grid</h2>
		    <p>Here you specify whether and  how a vertical data grid should be drawn in order to make the reading of the  graph easier.</p>
			  <p>&quot;<strong>Do not display a grid</strong>&quot;  switches the grid off.</p>
			  <p>&quot;<strong>Grid aligned on dataset  indices</strong>&quot; will show a grid aligned on dataset indices. For example, if you  choose grid size to be <samp>10</samp>, you will see a vertical line every 10 data sets.  Note that if you choose a data series for the X-axis (see below), it might be  the case that the X-coordinates do not correspond to the dataset indices. In  such case the vertical grid lines will be spaced at different intervals from  one another.</p>
			  <p>&quot;<strong>Grid aligned on X-axis units</strong>&quot; aligns the grid according to the X-axis. This way the grid lines will always  be equi-spaced. For instance, if you choose this option and set the grid size  to <samp>100</samp>, a vertical grid line will be shown every 100 units along the X-axis.</p>
			  <p>&quot;<strong>Grid size</strong>&quot; specifies the intervals at which vertical grid linen should be drawn. A value <var>S</var> here will cause a grid line to  be drawn every <var>S</var> units (or datasets, depending on the above option).<br />
		      Note that a grid is not of much use if the distance between the grid lines is less than a pixel. LiveGraph will help you by adjusting your settings in case they would cause the grid lines to be too close to each other. </p>
			  <p>&quot;<strong>Grid colour</strong>&quot; specifies the  colour to use for the vertical grid lines.</p>
			  <h2>Horizontal grid</h2>
		    <p>Here you specify whether and  how a horizontal data grid should be drawn in order to make the reading of the  graph easier.</p>
			  <p>&quot;<strong>Do not display a grid</strong>&quot;  switches the grid off.</p>
			  <p>&quot;<strong>Display a horizontal grid</strong>&quot;  will cause the grid to be drawn.</p>
			  <p>&quot;<strong>Grid size</strong>&quot; specifies the intervals at which horizontal grid lines should be drawn. A value <var>S</var> here will cause a grid line  to be drawn every <var>S</var> units along the Y-axis.<br />
		      Note that a grid is not of much use if the distance between the grid lines is less than a pixel. LiveGraph will help you by adjusting your settings in case they would cause the grid lines to be too close to each other. </p>
			  <p>&quot;<strong>Grid colour</strong>&quot; specifies the  colour to use for the horizontal grid lines.</p>
			  <h2>X axis</h2>
			  <p>Here you configure the x-axis  of the plot.</p>
			  <p>If &quot;<strong>Use dataset number</strong>&quot; is  selected, all data series will be plotted against the dataset numbers. This  means that for each data point, the Y-coordinate value will be its data value  and the X-coordinate value will be the index of the corresponding dataset in  the original data file (i.e. the row number of the data point in the file).</p>
			  <p>If &quot;<strong>Use data series</strong>&quot; is  selected, all data will be plotted against the data series specified in the  drop-down box &quot;Series&quot;. This means that for each data point, the Y-coordinate  will be its data value and the X-coordinate will be the data value of the  specified series from the same dataset.</p>
			  <p>The option &quot;<strong>Use data series  transformed into [0...1]</strong>&quot; is similar to the option &quot;Use data series&quot;, only the  X-coordinates are additionally transformed into the interval [0…1] such that  the smallest value in the data series specified to act as the X-axis is mapped to  0, the largest value is mapped to 1 and all other values are linearly mapped to the  values in-between. This means that for each data point, the Y-coordinate will  be its data value and the X-coordinate will be the value <var>x’</var> = <var>f</var><var>x</var> + <var>s</var>, where <var>x</var> is  the data value of the specified series from the same dataset, and <var>f</var> and <var>s</var> are  such that min( <var>x’</var> ) = 0 and max(<var> x’</var> ) = 1.</p>
			  <p>The option &quot;<strong>Use data series  scaled by set value</strong>&quot; is similar to the option &quot;Use data series&quot;, only the  X-coordinates are additionally scaled by the value specified in the field  &quot;Value&quot;. This means that for each data point, the Y-coordinate will be its data  value <var>x’</var> = <var>f</var><var>x</var>, where <var>x</var> is  the data value of the specified series from the same dataset, and <var>f</var> is the value specified in  the field &quot;Value&quot;.</p>
			  <p>The drop-down selector  &quot;<strong>Series</strong>&quot; lets you specify the data series to use as the X-axis if one of the  options &quot;Use data series&quot;, &quot;Use data series transformed into [0...1]&quot; or &quot;Use  data series scaled by set value&quot; is selected.</p>
			  <p>The field &quot;<strong>Value</strong>&quot; lets you  specify the scale value which is used when the option &quot;Use data series scaled  by set value&quot; is selected.<br />
		      Note, in order to apply the changes after you have  edited a value in this field, you need to press the Enter-key or to move the cursor out of the field by  clicking on any other field or button in the graph settings window.</p>
