*** Running LiveGraph ***

Depending on which distribution you have downloaded you need to execute
one of the two following JAR files. You can do this by typing either

    > java –jar LiveGraph.2.0.beta01.Application.bin.jar

or

    > java –jar LiveGraph.2.0.beta01.Complete.jar

In most operating systems it is sufficient to simply double-click on
the LiveGraph JAR file.

You can use the included icon file (LiveGraph.ico) to create a shortcut
to LiveGraph in your operating system’s programs menu.
