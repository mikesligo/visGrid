			  <h1>Why LiveGraph?</h1>
			  <p class="sectionIntro">In this section we describe  what motivated us to create LiveGraph and which distinctive features separate  it from other data visualisation tools. We discuss LiveGraph's strengths and weaknesses  and provide a short overview of alternative tools.</p>
			  <h2>The problem </h2>
			  <p>In our research group at the  <a href="http://infotech.monash.edu/research/groups/cris/index.html" target="_blank">Centre for Intelligent</a> and <a href="http://www.complexity.org.au/vlab" target="_blank">Complex Systems</a> at <a href="http://www.monash.edu" target="_blank">Monash University</a> we create a lot of  different computer simulations. The simulations usually produce a lot of data,  which is normally analysed after the simulation has finished. The analysis is a  lengthy process. During the first stages we often create a lot of graphs which  tell us various things about the data. Often the most important conclusion we  draw from a data plot is that we need to re-run the simulation with a different  set of parameters. This can be frustrating, as sometimes the simulations have  to run for many hours, or even several days. Fortunately, we often can recognise  that simulation parameters must be changed already soon after  starting the simulation, provided we are able to see our graphs instantly.</p>
			  <p>We realised that  almost every time we created a new simulation, we also created a new data  visualisation module in order to be able to watch how the simulation variables change  during the simulationâ€™s live-time. In the vast majority of cases these  visualisation modules are some kind of  graph plotters. Rather than  computing advanced data analysis functions (these are more  interesting at a latter stage, when the results of a completed simulation are  analysed), the visualisation modules were plotting graphs of variables directly  known to the simulation. (For instance, number of agents, relative proportions of  different populations, best or average fitness and so on.) Researchers and  students wasted many, many hours on these repetitive programming tasks instead of  concentrating on the actual simulation models. We realised that we needed a tool which would  save us doing this work. The tool had to be so easy to use that researchers and  students coming from diverse research areas, having varying programming  experiences and preferring different programming languages could make advantage  of it.</p>
			  <p>There are many plotting tools  around, some of which offer very advanced data analysis features. However, we could not find a tool suitable for our  requirements - being able to plug into various applications and plot their  output in real-time. So we finally decided to develop a tool ourselves.  This is how LiveGraph was born.</p>
			  <h2>The solution</h2>
			  <p>To be usable across a wide  range of applications the plotter had to be very loosely coupled with the software  which uses it. We decided to use a file stream as a communication buffer. An  application would write the data it wants to be plotted in a common comma-separated-values  text file. This is a really very easy requirement to an application developer,  especially, as scientific simulations often generate this data anyway. An  independently running Java application would monitor the data file written by  the simulation and plot graphs of data contained in the file. The plotter can  update the graphs automatically at very short time intervals, producing a graph  of the data literally live.</p>
			  <p>Since the amounts of the data  are often very large, we developed a special caching technique. As a  result, the plotter does not put any significant load on the processor(s) of the  machine where it is running. Another challenge was that a data file produced by  a simulation often contains a lot more data than you would like to see at any  one time. So we taught our plotter to automatically recognise the data series  contained in a file and their labels. We created a neat graphical user  interface for LiveGraph which lets you select the data series you would like to  see at any one time by a single click of the mouse.<br />
		    In addition we developed a  Java API which provides a convenient, easy-to-use class library that can be  used by Java applications when they wish to write data to files in the format  accepted by LiveGraph. For those who use other programming languages we provide  a definition of this file format, such that application developers can create  data log files using their own routines. We hope that the open source community  will contribute to the project by providing data writer APIs for more  programming languages.</p>
			  <p>There are various systems available for comprehensive data analysis in a post-simulation phase.  <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info" target="_blank">GNUPlot</a> is a very powerful plotter  system featuring its own scripting language. Computer algebra and numerical  computation packages such as <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/" target="_blank">Mathematica</a>, <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com" target="_blank">Maple</a> or <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/" target="_blank">Mathlab</a> also often  offer advanced plotting facilities along with powerful statistical and mathematical  tools. All these systems are very powerful, but they usually require a lot of effort in data preparation and trade off a lot of advances features for a slow-to-use user interface.</p>
			  <p>LiveGraph, on contrary, is a professional solution for exploratory data analysis. It is particularly useful when exploring the parameter space of a simulation model or while visually searching data for patters or interesting features. It allows  for live monitoring of real-time data and can easily be  integrated into any software. The focus lies on a very fast and easy to use  interface, rather than on powerful analysis tools. If this is what you need, you  certainly should consider LiveGraph as an option.</p>
			  <p>In the <a href="userManual.html">user manual</a> we describe  the how to use the LiveGraph plotter application in detail; in the <a href="developerManual.html">developer  manual</a> we explain how to incorporate the functionality of LiveGraph in your  application.</p>
